In this project we shed the light on:
* Source code management which is based on organizing chronological iterations of a code using version control. Each project is represented by a repository, it has branches that correspond to the work of different developers. The projects a project history of all the logs done for the project.
* Git is a source code management tool. Git is known as a decentralized system that is characterized by its organized structure for code iterations. Iterations are stored as commits in a tree structure.
* Github is an online service for Git that provides additional services on top of it.
* Downloading Vagrant and virtual machine on our personal computers.
* Creating a project on Github and doing basic tasks as adding README files.
